However, any context-free grammar may be transformed (after convention) to a CNF grammar expressing the same language"

        "*The Cocke–Younger–Kasami (CYK) algorithm is a parsing algorithm for context-free grammars that uses dynamic programming. It works by building a table that represents all possible substrings of the input word and the non-terminal symbols that can generate those substrings.*\n",

        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Input: The algorithm takes a word and a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) as input. CNF means that all production rules are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initialization: A table (usually represented as a 2D array) is created. The table's dimensions are n x n, where n is the length of the input word.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Each cell table[i][j] will store a set of non-terminal symbols that can generate the substring of the word starting at index i and ending at index j.\n",
        "Filling the Diagonal: The first step is to fill the diagonal cells of the table.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. For each cell table[i][i], the algorithm checks if any production rule in the grammar can generate the single character word[i]. If a rule A -> word[i] exists, then the non-terminal symbol A is added to table[i][i].\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Filling the Rest of the Table: The algorithm then proceeds to fill the rest of the table by considering substrings of increasing length. For each substring of length length (from 2 to n), starting at index i and ending at index j (where j = i + length - 1), the algorithm considers all possible split points k within the substring (from i to j-1).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Applying Production Rules: For each split point k, the algorithm checks if there is a production rule A -> BC in the grammar such that B is in table[i][k] (meaning B can generate the substring from i to k) and C is in table[k+1][j] (meaning C can generate the substring from k+1 to j). If such a rule exists, the non-terminal symbol A is added to table[i][j].\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Final Check: After the entire table is filled, the algorithm checks if the start symbol of the grammar is present in the top-right cell table[0][n-1]. This cell represents the entire input word. If the start symbol is in this cell, it means the entire word can be generated by the grammar, and thus the word is in the language. Otherwise, the word is not in the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, the CYK algorithm systematically builds up the set of possible non-terminals that can generate every substring of the input word, using the production rules of the grammar. By checking the top-right cell for the start symbol, it determines if the entire word is a valid sentence in the language defined by the grammar."

If a rule can create that letter, you write down the name of that rule (the non-terminal) in the grid cell corresponding to that letter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Filling the Rest of the Grid: Now you start looking at bigger and bigger chunks of your word. For each chunk, you split it into two smaller chunks in all possible ways. For each split, you look at the rules you found for the two smaller chunks in the previous steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you find a rule that says you can combine the rules from the two smaller chunks to make a new rule, you write down the name of that new rule in the grid cell for the larger chunk.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Final Check: Once you've filled the entire grid, you look at the very last cell in the top right corner. This cell represents the entire word. You check if the main rule of your language (the start symbol) is in that cell. If it is, it means your word can be built using your rules, and it's a valid word in your language! If the main rule isn't there, the word is not valid.\n",
